# BlogAngularV2

This project is only as example.

I made the minimum functionality as a confirmation of my skills and understanding of the work of the Angular framework.

To speed up the development process, I used realtimedatabase from Firebase using Rest API.

In the future, if I have free time, I will develop a Backend based on Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Hibernate and MySQL (or postgre SQL). This is also very simple in general, but development takes a little more time than directly interacting from Angular with the Fairbase database.


## Autorisation

Made by Firebase rest API.

Registration of new users is not made in App, only in admin of Firebase, because admin side of this app is using only by one person - writer/blogger,

Maybe in the future, I will add in app customs comments and registration for customers
