# BlogAngularV2

This project is only as example.

I made the minimum functionality as a confirmation of my skills and understanding of the work of the Angular framework.

To speed up the development process, I used realtimedatabase from Firebase using Rest API.

In the future, if I have free time, I will develop a Backend based on Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Hibernate and MySQL (or postgre SQL). This is also very simple in general, but development takes a little more time than directly interacting from Angular with the Fairbase database.

## Link to APP

Link to app `https://blog-angular-1b6c8.web.app/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Autorisation

Made by Firebase rest API.

login: `artemvovk7777777@gmail.com`
password: `111111`

Registration of new users is not made in App, only in admin of Firebase, because admin side of this app is using only by one person - writer/blogger,

Maybe in the future, I will add in app customs comments and registration for customers
